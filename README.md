# Huntnroll

> Decide who starts â€” fairly and visually!

## Overview

Huntnroll is a simple Python app to help groups decide who gets to start (e.g., who gets the first day in the hunting season, or any other turn-based activity). It provides both a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy use.

- **Uniform random selection:** Every participant has an equal chance of being chosen.
- **Visual feedback:** The GUI shows a clear, graphical representation of the selection process.
- **Easy to use:** Enter names, click a button, and see the result!

---

## Features

- **CLI mode:** Run from the terminal to select a starter from a list of names.
- **GUI mode:** Enter names in a window, see a visual distribution, and get instant results.
- **Fairness:** Uses a uniform distribution so every name is equally likely to be picked.
- **Statistics:** See the selected index, percentile, and a visual bar chart of the distribution.
